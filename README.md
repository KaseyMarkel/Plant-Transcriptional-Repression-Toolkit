# Plant-Transcriptional-Repression-Toolkit

This repo houses the code to perform all analyses and generate all figures in the manuscript "sign and characterization of a transcriptional repression toolkit for plants". 

We hope that publishing our code will facilitate re-use and make our science more transparent.

The abstract of the manuscript is copied below to give context:

Regulation of gene expression is essential for all life. Tools to manipulate gene expression level have therefore proven to be very valuable in efforts to engineer biological systems. However, there are few well-characterized genetic parts that reduce gene expression in plants, commonly known as transcriptional repressors. We characterized the repression activity of a library consisting of approximately 25% of the members of the largest known family of repressors. Combining sequence information with our trans-regulatory function data, we next generated a library of synthetic transcriptional repressors, with function predicted in advance. After characterizing our synthetic library, we demonstrate that not only are many of our synthetic constructs functional as repressors, but our advance predictions of repression strength were better than random guesses. We also assessed the functionality of known transcriptional repressors from a wide range of eukaryotes. Our study represents the largest plant repressor library experimentally characterized to date, providing unique opportunities for tuning transcription in plants.
